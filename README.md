# Welcome

This project will explore getting started developing with [Python](https://www.python.org) and Neo4j [Graph Data Science](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/) (GDS) as quickly as possible using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

## Examples

The first example in this repo explores loading data into a Neo4j graph database - using graph projects and Graph Data Science algorithms to answer some important questions.

Please see [EXAMPLE: Explore Neo4j Graph Data Science](./examples/example-01-neo4j-python-example-graph-projection/README.md) for more details.
